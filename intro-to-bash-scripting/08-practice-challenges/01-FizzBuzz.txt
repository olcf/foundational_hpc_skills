FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem that is a great first-time exercise. Here's how it works:

Given the numbers 1 through 100, print each number with the following ruleset:
	1) If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz"
	2) If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz"
	3) If the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, print "FizzBuzz"
	4) If the number is NOT a multiple of 3 OR 5, print the number regularly.
