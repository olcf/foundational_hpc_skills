In this folder you will find a subdirectory titled "noise"
It contains nothing but junk data - random noise that doesn't mean anything important.

Your job is to find the *largest* line of the *largest* text file using a bash script.


Print the following to screen:
	The name of the largest text file
	The contents of the largest line (within that text file)
	The line # of the largest line (within that text file)
	The line size of the largest line (within that file).


Bonus!!!!
	- Find and print to screen the average file size of each file
	- I hid a message in the winning file-line. See if you can find and decode it!
